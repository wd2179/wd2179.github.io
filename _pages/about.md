I am the Eli Ginzberg Professor of Finance and Economics at Columbia Business School. 

My research interests center on the economics of organizations (``organizational economics'') and firm strategy. 

At Columbia, I teach a popular elective on the `Economics of Strategic Behavior', a course which examines the underlying economics of successful business strategy.
