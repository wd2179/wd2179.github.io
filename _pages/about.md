I am the Eli Ginzberg Professor of Finance and Economics at Columbia Business School. My main area of research centers on the economics of organizations: the allocation of decision-rights in organizations, the organizational structure of multi-divisional firms, the role of managers in setting firm strategy, and the impact of corporate leaders on the long-term performance of firms (and much more!). I am also interested in firm strategy and the sources of persistent performance differences between firms. My research has been published in leading journals such as the American Economic Review, the Journal of Political Economy, the Review of Economic Studies, Management Science and the Journal of Finance. 

At Columbia, I teach a popular elective on the `Economics of Strategic Behavior', a course which examines the underlying economics of successful business strategy. 

Prior to joining the Columbia Business School faculty , I was an assistant and associate professor of economics at the University of Chicago, Graduate School of Business. I earned a Bachelor in management and applied sciences (`Handelsingenieur') from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, and a Ph.D. in economics, jointly awarded by Toulouse University and the Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB).
