I am the Eli Ginzberg Professor of Finance and Economics at Columbia Business School. My main area of research centers on the economics of organizations. I am also interested in firm strategy. 

At Columbia, I teach a popular elective on the `Economics of Strategic Behavior', a course which examines the underlying economics of successful business strategy. 

I earned a Bachelor in management and applied sciences (`Handelsingenieur') from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, and a Ph.D. in economics, jointly awarded by Toulouse University and the Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB).
