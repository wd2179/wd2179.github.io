title: "Dynamic Barriers to Entry"
collection: publications
category: working papers

excerpt: 'Many industries are dominated by large and very profitable firms. We provide a theory of dynamic entry barriers, where competing firms operate a fixed-cost technology but can only slowly build up a customer base. Entrepreneurs and new customers arrive each period. Entrepreneurs decide whether to found a firm and enter, whereas new customers are randomly matched to firms. Existing customers decide to stick with matched firms, and firms can increase customer retention by investing in product quality. <br> We show that: (1) There is an incumbency advantage. Earlier entrants are larger and more profitable; no more entry occurs after some time. Firms only upgrade product quality when they are sufficiently large; late entrants may never upgrade and are smaller/less profitable, even in the long-run. (2) Lower fixed costs reduce average product quality. (3) Long-run profitability is increasing in fixed costs and customer inertia, but decreasing in firm patience. (4) High fixed costs create an entry barrier paradox. When quality upgrading is not feasible, entrepreneurs always prefer markets with low fixed costs; with quality upgrading, early movers may prefer markets with high fixed costs.'
