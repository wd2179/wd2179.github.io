title: "Subordinates in Charge: Does Delegation Improve Bank Supervision?"
collection: publications
category: working papers
excerpt: 'We study a policy reform that delegated supervisory decision-making authority for a subset of bank branches to a lower hierarchy. Consistent with a model of information loss in supervisory communication, we find improved supervisory outcomes following the reform: Supervisory interventions indicate better detection of misconduct by banks as well as a better assessment of the severity of misconduct. The effects are more pronounced when (i) centralized decision-making deters access to local information, and (ii) uncertainty about the local environment is high, aligning with theoretical predictions. Our findings highlight decentralization benefits within a supervisory hierarchy.'
